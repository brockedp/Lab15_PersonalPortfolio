        <h2>About Deno Brockert</h2>
        <p class = "about">
            I was born in Macomb County where I grew up with my teenage years being in Armada, Michigan. I graduated from Armada High School in 2008. Throughout my childhood 
            and into my adulthood, I have played ice hokcey and golf. After high school, I attanded University of Detroit Mercy where I focused my studies on biology with a 
            concentration in pre-dentistry. During my undergraduate studies, I was a founding member of the school ACHA hockey team. I graduated with my bachelors in biology 
            in 2012. After graduating from Detroit Mercy, I realized I did not want to work in the medical field and began work in the controls automation. While working in
            this industry, I was drawn towards the software side of projects. I wrote ladder logic programs and designed HMI applications. There process of creating programs
            and applications were repetitve. That is lead me to want to learn coding and my journey to Grand Circus. Supporting me in this journey is my wife Laurel Brockert.
