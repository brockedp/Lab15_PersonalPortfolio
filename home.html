        <h4>Developing</h4>
        <p>
            I have always loved to tinker and learn how everything around me functions. When growing up, I would mess around with my hockey equipment, whether that be curving my
            hockey sticks, making my own blades for my stick or building different training devices. I went to college to learn about how the human body works. I became really interested
            in how software works when working in controls automation. The more I began working with software, the more I wanted to know the bit and bytes of it all. I began developing 
            spreadsheets of formulas and dripped my feet in coding with python. Have built little programs that range from finding averages to sorting csv files for labor reports. I want 
            to learn an array of languages so I can create whatever comes to mind.

        <h4>Food</h4>
        <p>
            I love food. Not only does it give the body energy but it brings people together. I enjoy cooking and trying to create my own recipes. Being able to make food for others
            and trying others' food has benefited me in being able to accept feedback. I know I am not a great cook but that is what is fun about it. Trying to bring together a recipe by
            following the directions then picking out what you like in that recipe and trying to create something of your own. Chopping and mixing have become relaxing and enjoyable to the 
            point where I use it to decompress from the day.

        <h4>Hometown</h4>
        <p>
            My hometown is New Haven, MI. New Haven is a village in Lenox Township within Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan.
            The 2017 Census Bureau Estimate places the population at 4,752. The first settlers in the New Haven area were chiefly the Native Americans of the Ojibwa/Cherokee tribe. 
            The Swan Creek Chippewa is a predominant segment of the tribe. French settlers came to the area in 1835 when the first land was purchased from the federal government. 
            The settlement was originally called “New Baltimore Station” because of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad depot located there that did its main commerce with the Village of New Baltimore, 
            on Anchor Bay and at the other end of the New Haven/Romeo plank road (also known as the Ashley/Romeo Plank Road) that served the area. The portion of the plank road that 
            went through the village became the main road of New Haven. This road changes its name a few times, becoming Main Street in New Haven and Washington Street in New Baltimore.
